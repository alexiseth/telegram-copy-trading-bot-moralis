# Test Files

This folder contains test files created during development and optimization.

## Test Files:

- `test-bot.js` - Simple bot test for basic polling functionality
- `test-status.js` - Direct test of status command functionality  
- `test-transactions.js` - Direct test of transactions command with Moralis API

## Usage:

```bash
# Test status functionality
node tests/test-status.js

# Test transactions functionality  
node tests/test-transactions.js

# Test basic bot polling
node tests/test-bot.js
```

## Notes:

These are development test files used to debug and optimize bot performance.
They can be used to test individual components without running the full bot.
